# Changelog

All notable changes to DeepSeek Balance Monitor are documented here.

Where older release notes were not present in the repository, entries were reconstructed from git tags and commit history.

## Rust v1.2 (2026-05-11)

### Added

- Rust Windows and Rust Linux are now versioned as `1.2.0` across Cargo metadata, Windows manifest, and Plasma widget metadata.
- Encrypted SQLite `secure_settings` API key storage for both Rust Windows and Rust Linux.
- Automatic migration from legacy plaintext `config.json.api_key` into encrypted SQLite storage.
- Rust demo mode enabled by saving `demo` as the API key; demo data is stored in an isolated `demo_mode_balance` table.
- Rust Linux `dsmon set-key` command for encrypted API key updates.
- Rust Linux `dsmon set <field> <value>` command for single-field configuration updates.
- Rust Linux installer prompts for an API key when the first check has no key or detects an invalid key.
- Rust Linux package includes `uninstall.sh` for removing `dsmon` and the systemd user service while leaving active Plasma widget files untouched.
- Plasma 6 desktop widget liquid-glass view with balance, last check, API service status, estimated availability, refresh control, and emoji status text.
- Optional Rainmeter desktop widget skin backed by a local-only `127.0.0.1:17654` status interface; Rust Windows currently provides the interface and Python Windows can adopt the same contract later.
- GitHub Actions now builds a release `.rmskin` package with `rmskin-builder` from `2bndy5/rmskin-action`.

### Changed

- Rust Linux daemon reloads configuration on every polling cycle so CLI changes are picked up without restarting the service.
- Rust Linux CLI output is English-only and no longer sends desktop notifications.
- Rust Windows opens the settings dialog on first launch when no API key is available.
- Rust Windows and Rust Linux separate `ui_language` from fixed English CLI `language`.
- Rust CSV exports default to the user's home directory and use date-suffixed filenames.
- Rust Windows and Rust Linux keep demo balance data out of the real `balance_history` table.
- Plasma widget settings use the new `dsmon set` command path instead of the legacy bulk `set-config` flow.

## Python v1.2 (2026-05-11)

### Added

- Custom icon styling with 5 preset colour themes: Default, High Contrast, Bright, Dark Mode, and Monochrome.
- Custom hex colour editor and icon stroke toggle.
- History viewer with paginated balance records, an interactive trend chart, and consumption rate analysis.
- CSV export with a configurable save path.
- Consumption rate estimation with daily average spend and projected days/hours remaining in balance notifications and history views.
- Demo mode with a developer tools panel for testing without a real API key.
- HTTP proxy support for restricted network environments.
- Windows Credential Manager integration so API keys are stored encrypted instead of plaintext in `config.json`.
- macOS WebView-based settings UI.
- Unit test coverage for core API parsing and state transitions.

### Changed

- Balance detail notifications now use emoji-prefixed lines.
- Last-check time is displayed as a relative time.
- API service status is recorded alongside each balance history entry.
- Settings, history, and developer tools share one Tk root window to avoid window-state conflicts.
- Settings validation now shows clearer errors and includes version, contributor, and project-link information.
- macOS build script gained DMG packaging support.

- Community ports:

### Changed
