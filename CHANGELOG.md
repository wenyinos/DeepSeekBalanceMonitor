# Changelog

All notable changes to DeepSeek Balance Monitor are documented here.

## Rust v1.4.1 (2026-09-01)

### Changed

- Linux installation is now fully user-level: the installer writes `dsmon` to `~/.local/bin`, the systemd service to `~/.config/systemd/user/`, and the Plasma widget plus its icon under `~/.local/share/` — no sudo is required, and root is no longer enforced
- The Plasma widget now resolves `dsmon` through `$PATH` instead of a hard-coded `/usr/local/bin/dsmon`, so it works with the user-level binary; the installer auto-adds `~/.local/bin` to the shell profile when missing
- On install, the script detects leftover system-level files from older versions (`/usr/local/bin/dsmon`, `/etc/systemd/user/dsmon.service`, `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/…`, `/usr/share/icons/…`) and offers to remove them via `sudo` (asking for confirmation first); the uninstaller is likewise user-level
- The installer now runs `systemctl --user enable --now dsmon.service` after installation, so the daemon is set to auto-start on login and starts immediately
- On non-systemd distributions (e.g. OpenRC), the installer skips the systemd service file and instead writes a desktop autostart entry (`~/.config/autostart/deepseek-balance-monitor.desktop`) that starts the daemon at desktop login

## Rust v1.4.0 (2026-09-01)

### Added

- Command Code quota display (Rust Windows and Rust Linux): queries `api.commandcode.ai/alpha/billing/credits` (with `orgId` from `alpha/whoami`) and reports 5h / weekly / monthly usage. Monthly is derived for GOAT plans (70 credits) and left unavailable for other plans
- Windows: the settings dialog gains a "Subscriptions" tab holding both OpenCode Go and Command Code quota groups (each with three usage progress bars and a refresh button); all API keys (DeepSeek, OpenCode Go, Command Code) are entered on the Account tab
- Linux: new `dsmon command-code` (query quota), `dsmon command-code set-key <api_key>` (store the API key), and `dsmon command-code json` (JSON output) CLI commands
- Linux: the Plasma 6 widget gains a "Subscriptions" settings page showing OpenCode Go and Command Code quota, with credentials kept on the Account page; the widget main view adds a Command Code section with three usage progress bars
- Command Code API key is stored encrypted in the `secure_settings` table under the `command_code_api_key` key, never written to config.json
- Rust Windows: the local Rainmeter `/widget-status` interface now also exposes Command Code quota fields (`cc_configured`, `cc_error`, `cc_5h/weekly/monthly_percent` and `_line`), refreshed every 10 minutes by a background thread with last-good retention on failure — an interface reserve for the upcoming Rainmeter skin integration; the contract is documented in `rainmeter-widget/PYTHON_RAINMETER_INTEGRATION.md`

## Rust v1.3.3 (2026-08-30)

### Changed

- Rust Windows migrated from native-tls (Schannel) to rustls with embedded webpki-roots, matching rust-linux: no OS certificate store is consulted, Windows 7/8.1 installs validate out of the box, and TLS 1.3 is now available on old systems; TLS-inspecting proxies or security software will fail certificate validation since only the embedded root store is trusted
- Removed `scripts/update_windows_root_certs.bat`, unnecessary after the embedded-root migration (Py-Win requires Windows 10+ anyway); README TLS sections and directory trees updated accordingly

### Fixed

- Settings window font rendering: bold group titles no longer hardcode Segoe UI, whose missing CJK glyphs caused font fallback or tofu on the Chinese UI — the heading font now follows the unified UI family with real font enumeration (Microsoft YaHei UI, falling back to Microsoft YaHei / SimSun), and a stray 9-pixel size that rendered titles smaller than body text was dropped

## Rust v1.3.2 (2026-08-14)

### Changed

- Plasma 6 widget settings redesigned to match rust-windows: a new "Account" page holds both API keys (DeepSeek and OpenCode Go) plus the OpenCode quota bars; the General page is organised into Query / General / Proxy / Icon Appearance groups; the separate "OpenCode Go" settings page is merged into Account
- Plasma widget main view redesigned: the DeepSeek section follows a four-line layout (balance, last check, API status, estimated availability) with the refresh button moved to the top-right corner refreshing DeepSeek and OpenCode together; the OpenCode section shows three usage progress bars with larger type and bars
- Font hierarchy and spacing adjusted across both sections for a clearer visual order
- Rust Windows: the local Rainmeter `/widget-status` interface now includes OpenCode Go quota fields (`og_configured`, `og_error`, `og_rolling/weekly/monthly_percent` and `_line`), refreshed every 10 minutes by a background thread with last-good retention on failure; the interface contract and Python-port guidance are documented in `rainmeter-widget/PYTHON_RAINMETER_INTEGRATION.md`

## Rust v1.3.1 (2026-08-14)

### Changed

- Windows settings window redesigned: a new "Account" tab groups the DeepSeek and OpenCode Go API keys; the Settings tab is organised into Query / General / Proxy / Icon Appearance groups with bold titles and separator lines; all controls are aligned to a consistent grid with unified label and input columns

## Rust v1.3.0 (2026-08-14)

### Changed

- OpenCode Go quota now uses the official API (`opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage`) with a Bearer API key, replacing the workspace-dashboard scraper (workspace ID + auth cookie)
- Credentials simplified to a single API key, stored encrypted in the `secure_settings` table under `opencode_go_api_key`, never written to config.json
- Windows: the "OpenCode Go" settings tab now takes an API key instead of workspace ID / auth cookie
- Linux: `dsmon opencode-go set-key <api_key>` stores the API key; without an argument it reads from stdin, matching `dsmon set-key`
- Plasma: the "OpenCode Go" settings page gains API key input with save (same pattern as the DeepSeek key), and the quota progress bars use `QtControls.ProgressBar` for reliable rendering

## Rust v1.2.10 (2026-08-02)

### Added

- OpenCode Go quota display (Rust Windows and Rust Linux): queries the official `opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/usage` API with a Bearer API key and reports rolling (~5h), weekly, and monthly usage as used/remaining percentages with reset time
- Windows: the settings dialog gains an "OpenCode Go" tab with an API key input and a manual refresh button
- Linux: new `dsmon opencode-go` (query quota), `dsmon opencode-go set-key <api_key>` (store the API key), and `dsmon opencode-go json` (JSON output) CLI commands
- Linux: the Plasma 6 widget adds a dedicated "OpenCode Go" settings page showing quota, read directly from `dsmon opencode-go json`
- OpenCode Go API key is stored encrypted in the `secure_settings` table under the `opencode_go_api_key` key, never written to config.json

## Rust v1.2.6 (2026-06-08)

### Changed

- Consumption rate algorithm upgraded to busy-hour slicing (ported from Python v1.2.7): filters long idle gaps and flat periods; returns hourly rate instead of daily average
- Unified display format across all platforms:
  - Chinese: `📊 忙时消耗 0.06/小时 | 预计可用 28 天 4 小时`
  - English: `📊 Busy: 0.06/hr | Est. 28d 4h remaining`
- Updated `ConsumptionRate` struct: `daily_rate` → `hourly_rate`, `hours_left` → `busy_hours_left`
- Updated demo mode to use new rate fields
- Plasma widget updated to display hourly consumption rate

### Platform-Specific

- **Rust Windows**: Added `estimated_line` field to Rainmeter widget-status interface
- **Rust Linux**: Removed `estimated_line` (not needed for Plasma widget; uses `consumption_rate` field directly)

## Python v1.2.7 (2026-05-28)

### Fixed

- Fixed tkinter+pystray dual event-loop deadlock freezing the tray icon when settings/history dialogs were open

### Changed

- Consumption rate switched to busy-hour slicing algorithm: long idle gaps and flat periods are filtered out; displayed as hourly rate instead of daily average

## Python v1.2.6 (2026-05-13)

### Fixed

- Fixed connection refused and exit failure when system proxy (Clash etc.) goes down: empty `ProxyHandler` blocks system proxy, `socket.setdefaulttimeout` global fallback
- Fixed DNS resolution timeout blocking on network loss: global socket timeout + exit flag checks
- Fixed potential `cancel_timer` deadlock preventing `icon.stop()`: `icon.stop()` now runs before cleanup
- Removed API key `demo` trigger for dev mode: Python uses `--demo` CLI flag only

## Python v1.2.5 (2026-05-13)

### Added

- Developer Demo mode update: mock history data generated on startup; developer panel gains custom consumption rate & estimated hours display
- Custom icon colour live preview with hex validation on save
- History date filter with `YYYYMMDD` format query

### Changed

- History viewer extracted to `src/history_dialog.py`
- Tray notification and history page rate/time/prefix bilingual strings fully extracted to i18n keys

### Fixed

- Fixed settings "Enable proxy" off calling `install_proxy("")` with empty `ProxyHandler` overriding system proxy

## Rust v1.2.5 (2026-05-12)

### Added

- Standalone Plasma widget release asset: `deepseek-balance-monitor-*-plasmoid.plasmoid`
- Linux release tarballs now include the same Plasma widget package under `plasmoid/`
- Linux release assets include `checksums.txt` for tarball verification

### Changed

- Plasma widget display now follows the Rainmeter layout: balance line, relative last-check time, API service status, and estimated remaining time
- Plasma widget language settings now sync `cfg_language` back to `ui_language`, so English/Chinese selection survives Plasma restarts
- Low-balance display colour now takes priority over API-degraded colour, matching Rainmeter accent rules
- Rust Linux and Rust Windows service-status checks now use the FlashDuty-backed DeepSeek status page
- Consumption estimates use topped-balance history over a 7-day window, with retention-period fallback when needed
- Proxy settings now include an explicit enable toggle while preserving the proxy address when disabled

### Fixed

- Fixed Linux Plasma language changes appearing to reset after restarting `plasmashell`
- Fixed removed DeepSeek status REST API usage in Rust ports
- Fixed Windows settings title/footer behaviour to match the v1.2 settings design

## Python v1.2.2 (2026-05-12)

### Fixed

- Emergency migration of API service status monitoring to FlashDuty endpoint after DeepSeek replaced the underlying status page

## Python v1.2.1 (2026-05-12)

### Added

- Rainmeter `.rmskin` packaging script; CI auto-builds alongside EXE
- Rainmeter 2x high-DPI skin variants (ZH/EN)

### Changed

- API key storage unified to Fernet + SQLite, with legacy fallback; save_config() clears plaintext automatically
- Proxy now a checkbox toggle + address input; address is preserved when disabled
- Settings title simplified to `⚙️ Settings`, footer balance/last-check rows removed, version & contributor info shown
- Consumption rate restored to topped-balance with 7-day window and weighted average, plus retention fallback

## Rust v1.2 (2026-05-11)

### Added

- Rust Windows and Rust Linux versioned as `1.2.0`
- SQLite `secure_settings` encrypted API key storage (Rust Windows / Linux)
- Auto-migration from legacy plaintext `config.json.api_key` to encrypted storage
- Rust demo mode: save `demo` as the API key, data stored in isolated `demo_mode_balance` table
- Rust Linux `dsmon set-key` command for encrypted API key updates
- Rust Linux `dsmon set <field> <value>` command for single-field config updates
- Rust Linux installer prompts for API key on first launch when none is configured
- Rust Linux `uninstall.sh` script (preserves Plasma widget)
- Plasma 6 widget liquid-glass view with balance, last check, service status, estimated availability, refresh control, and emoji status text
- Rainmeter desktop widget via local `127.0.0.1:17654` interface; Rust Windows currently provides the interface
- GitHub Actions `.rmskin` packaging via `rmskin-builder`

### Changed

- Rust Linux daemon reloads config on each poll cycle; CLI changes take effect immediately
- Rust Linux CLI output is English-only, no desktop notifications
- Rust Windows opens settings dialog on first launch when no API key is configured
- Rust Windows/Linux separate `ui_language` (GUI) from `language` (CLI, fixed English)
